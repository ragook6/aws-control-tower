Terraform examples for Public Cloud

I have been working to build out a library of code I can use to deploy Infrastructure in AWS, Azure, GCP and other providers (such as VMware). All the stuff in this repository are available to run out of the box (without any change to the codebase) and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE file.


This repo contains Terraform code examples, variables and sample .tfvars files. 

Quick start
You must have access to an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account, a Microsoft Azure Tenant or a Google Cloud Subscription in order to run the samples therein.

The code consists of Terraform examples using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

All the code is in the subfolders for the respective Cloud Provider.

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder.

This is the list of examples:
